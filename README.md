# Math notes for machine learning

## Purpose

It can be challenging to motivate yourself to learn math after college ends, especially when you were never great at it in the first place. However, math (especially math geared towards data science) is a necessary skill for bioinformaticians who want to understand how to correctly use and develop algorithms. I'm hoping that this repo will help keep me motivated and that my notes will benefit others who find themselves in a similar situation. 

## Structure

The repo is divided by subject and then sub-modules in each. Notes are taken in jupyter notebook running `python v3.8.3`.
